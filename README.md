Basic Selenium examples creating a Selenium Framework

I wanted to learn Java and Selenium so I decided to start building a framework. I've been writing .NET code for over 3+ years
so learning Java was easy. I watched several videos and read several articles from John Sonmez, a software developer, on how to build
Selenium frameworks. John had a lot of knowledge and interesting ideas on how to build Selenium frameworks. 

My framework is built out statically. I built the framework this way for several reasons, but here are the main two reasons. By 
building out the framework statically I do not have to maintain state of the objects or driver in my test cases. This simplifies
the unit test and allows for better readability with clear intent of what the test are performing. By building the framework out
statically I can essentially build an internal DSL.
